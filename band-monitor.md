>Logster
>Logster is a utility for reading log files and generating metrics in Graphite or Ganglia. It is ideal for visualizing trends of events that are occurring in your application/system/error logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the number of occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server logs.

>Munin is a great piece of software for monitoring servers. However it’s well known that it’s central poller sucks at scale.
>Graphite looks like just the ticket for collating stats so I spent of my spare time recently investigating. After some research I found munin-graphite which was what I wanted to punt data from Munin to Graphite. However I wanted to decouple the two by using AMQP.
