## GNU Make

Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
other non-source files of a program from the program's source
files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
called the *makefile*, which lists each of the non-source files and
how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you
should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make
to build and install the program.

#### Capabilities of Make

-   Make enables the end user to build and install your package
    without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these
    details are recorded in the makefile that you supply.
-   Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update,
    based on which source files have changed. It also automatically
    determines the proper order for updating files, in case one
    non-source file depends on another non-source file.
    As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make, it
    does not need to recompile all of your program. It updates only
    those non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the
    source files that you changed.

-   Make is not limited to any particular language. For each
    non-source file in the program, the makefile specifies the shell
    commands to compute it. These shell commands can run a compiler to
    produce an object file, the linker to produce an executable, `ar`
    to update a library, or TeX or Makeinfo to format documentation.
-   Make is not limited to building a package. You can also use
    Make to control installing or deinstalling a package, generate tags
    tables for it, or anything else you want to do often enough to make
    it worth while writing down how to do it.

#### Make Rules and Targets

A *rule* in the makefile tells Make how to execute a series of
commands in order to build a *target* file from source files. It
also specifies a list of *dependencies* of the target file. This
list should include all files (whether source files or other
targets) which are used as inputs to the commands in the rule.

Here is what a simple rule looks like:

    target:   dependencies ...
              commands
              ...

When you run Make, you can specify particular targets to update;
otherwise, Make updates the first target listed in the makefile. Of
course, any other target files needed as input for generating these
targets must be updated first.

Make uses the makefile to figure out which target files ought to be
brought up to date, and then determines which of them actually need
to be updated. If a target file is newer than all of its
dependencies, then it is already up to date, and it does not need
to be regenerated. The other target files do need to be updated,
but in the right order: each target file must be regenerated before
it is used in regenerating other targets.

#### Advantages of GNU Make

GNU Make has many powerful features for use in makefiles, beyond
what other Make versions have. It can also regenerate, use, and
then delete intermediate files which need not be saved.

GNU Make also has a few simple features that are very convenient.
For example, the `-o <i>file</i>` option which says \`\`pretend
that source file *file* has not changed, even though it has
changed.'' This is extremely useful when you add a new macro to a
header file. Most versions of Make will assume they must therefore
recompile all the source files that use the header file; but GNU
Make gives you a way to avoid the recompilation, in the case where
you know your change to the header file does not require it.

However, the most important difference between GNU Make and most
versions of Make is that GNU Make is free software.

#### Makefiles And Conventions

We have developed conventions for how to write Makefiles, which all
GNU packages ought to follow. It is a good idea to follow these
conventions in your program even if you don't intend it to be GNU
software, so that users will be able to build your package just
like many other packages, and will not need to learn anything
special before doing so.

These conventions are found in the chapter
[\`\`Makefile conventions'' (147 k characters)](/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html#Makefile-Conventions)
of the
[GNU Coding Standards (147 k characters)](/prep/standards.html).

### Downloading GNU Make

GNU Make can be found on the main GNU ftp server:
[http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/) (via
HTTP) and
[ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/) (via
FTP). It can also be found on the [GNU mirrors](/prep/ftp.html);
please [use a mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/make/) if possible.

### Documentation

[Documentation for Make](manual/) is available online, as is
[documentation for most GNU software](/manual/). You may also find
more information about Make by running *info make* or *man make*,
or by looking at */usr/doc/make/*, */usr/local/doc/make/*, or
similar directories on your system. A brief summary is available by
running make --help.

### Mailing lists

Make has two mailing lists:
[<bug-make@gnu.org\>](mailto:bug-make@gnu.org) and
[<help-make@gnu.org\>](mailto:help-make@gnu.org).

The main discussion list is
[<bug-make@gnu.org\>](mailto:bug-make@gnu.org), and is used to
discuss most aspects of Make, including development and enhancement
requests, as well as bug reports.

There is a separate list for general user help and discussion,
[<help-make@gnu.org\>](mailto:help-make@gnu.org).

GNU Make has been ported to a great many systems. One that poses
unique challenges is Microsoft DOS and Windows platforms; because
of that there is a GNU Make mailing list dedicated specifically to
users of those platforms:
[<make-w32@gnu.org\>](mailto:make-w32@gnu.org).

Announcements about Make and most other GNU software are made on
[<info-gnu@gnu.org\>](mailto:info-gnu@gnu.org).

To subscribe to these or any GNU mailing lists, please send an
empty mail with a Subject: header of just subscribe to the relevant
-request list. For example, to subscribe yourself to the GNU
announcement list, you would send mail to
[<info-gnu-request@gnu.org\>](mailto:info-gnu-request@gnu.org?Subject=subscribe).
Or you can use the
[mailing list web interface](http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnu).

### Getting involved

Development of Make, and GNU in general, is a volunteer effort, and
you can contribute. For information, please read
[How to help GNU](/help/). If you'd like to get involved, it's a
good idea to join the discussion mailing list (see above).

Test releases
  ~ Trying the latest test release (when available) is always
    appreciated. Test releases of Make can be found at
    [http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/](http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/)
    (via HTTP) and
    [ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/](ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/) (via
    FTP).
Development
  ~ For development sources, bug and patch trackers, and other
    information, please see the
    [Make project page](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/) at
    [savannah.gnu.org](http://savannah.gnu.org).
Translating Make

Maintainer
  ~ GNU Make was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. It
    has been maintained and updated by Paul Smith since version 3.76
    (1997). Please use the mailing lists for contact.
